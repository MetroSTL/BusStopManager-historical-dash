# Historical Dashboard Documentation

The purpose of this application is to inspect past inspections. The way that it works is it sends out requests for a particular stop id. It checks the Stops and Ghost stops file on the open data store. Brings back all of the matches and displays them on the first panel. When you click on the panel all of the entries in the bus stop manager main feature service returns. When you click on one of those it then shows the results of that survey and you can open up a read-only version of the survey for inspection.

## getRecords() is where the requests are made
